### Android-Login-UI

This is the Interactive Login and Register User Interaction(UI) design. You will definitly like it once you will run this code in the Android Studio.
There are some screenshots of the completly UI Design and also upload one gif file of the UI from where i got the idea to implement it in the Android Programming.

Steps for Use it...
1. Start the app and the first screen will come up of the login page.
2. You have to fill Email And Password then the Sign In button will be visible otherwise not.
3. After click on Register Button you will redirect to another fragment. And when you click Sign In on the top then Sign In fragment will open.
4. In SignIn page fill the credentials and click sign in button below the password. You will go to next page(Dashboard).
